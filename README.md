# Introduction to Computer Science - Fall 2018

## Lab 1 - Variables, User Interaction, and Arithmetic

**Purpose:** The purpose of this lab is to introduce arithmetic to Python and user interaction. You will get some experience developing interactive programs with Python. You will design and write a simple program that computes the weighted average of scores in a typical college course.

**Practice:** Study the [Examples](http://itech190.erickuha.com/) from the chapter.

**Instructions:** Create a python script file called _grades.py_ that serves as an interactive weighted-average calculator. The output should start out with a brief description of what the program does and what the user should do. It should instructions that list the following information:

* Homework is worth 25% of the final grade
* Labs are worth 20% of the final grade
* The Midterm Exam is worth 25% of the final grade
* The Final Exam is worth 30% of the final grade

Next, the program should ask the user to enter their scores for each of the four graded items: Homework, Labs, the Midterm Exam, and the Final Exam. Note that you can assume that the scores they enter are out of 100.

The program should then calculate the weighted average for the person. It should then display the average, along with a descriptive message. For example, if the person entered 92, 86, 95, 88, the calculation would be:

`average = 92 * 0.25 + 86 * 0.20 + 95 * 0.25 + 88 * 0.30`

The output should be something like:

`Your weighted average is 90.35`

Your program must contain the following:

* It must use at least four variables
* There must be at least one assignment statement using the variables
* Be sure that you **test** your program. At the very least, it should give the response that is in the example above. In addition, you should create your own set of inputs. Use a calculator to determine the correct output and then verify that your program gives the same results.

Once you have completed the assignment, push it back to your repository for grading.
